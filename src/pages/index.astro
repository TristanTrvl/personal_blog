					<h2>Now</h2>
					<p>Developing skill through doing, guiltlessly exploring passion and interests, imbuing quality. Mindful that everything around me is someone’s life work.</p>
					<p>All I want to do is build websites. Typography, motion design, copywriting, performance—the web is an endless medium of opportunity and creativity of which I’ve only scratched the surface.</p>
					<p>Enjoying deep, dark, boring dance music: songs that set the pace in the first ten seconds and maintain it for the next ten minutes. Deep is a curation of my favorites. Soothed by the inherent energy of drum and bass—Drum has my favorites.</p>
